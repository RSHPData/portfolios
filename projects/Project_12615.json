  "overview": "<div><p>With a building height of 245m and clad in warm metallic finishes, Qianhai Financial Holdings Building is a commercial high-rise in the centre of the Qianhai district in Shenzhen, China. The unique structural system of this building creates a community-friendly arcade space that captures the characteristics of Lingnan: the river, the bay, and the area south of the Nanling Mountains.</p><p>At street level, four mega-columns allow for a five-storey podium building to be held aloft, creating a striking undercroft that makes way for a free-flowing public ground plane with a new park, underground retail, and connections to the metro.</p><p>Punctuating and contrasting with the tower’s order and rectilinearity are two triple-height sky lobbies created for its major clients, Century Securities and Qianhai Financial Holdings. These vertical villages create a diverse, elegant, green, and low-carbon office headquarters which frame the views toward the mountains, bay, and river.</p><p>At the top of the building there is a simple glazed octagon amenity space which offers 360° views of the wider bay area and beyond. Further outdoor landscaped amenity space can be found under the soaring wings of the building’s feature crown. Composed of inclined double-mesh facades, the crown catches the warmth of the daytime sun, and at night becomes a beacon on the skyline.</p></div>",
