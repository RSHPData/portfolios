  "overview": "<div><p>Stratford Cross, formerly known as International Quarter London, (IQL) is an evolving cultural and commercial workplace destination in the east of London. Situated in 560 acres of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, The London Stadium and the creative institutions of the East Bank, the area is joint venture between Lendlease and London Continental Railways to create a thriving business quarter at the heart of London’s newest metropolitan area, Stratford City, E20.</p><p>In 2014, RSHP was commissioned to create a masterplan for the commercial space, which is spread over north and south sites, and provide a design framework that enables buildings of varied sizes and configurations to be created using the same basic components. This ‘kit-of-parts’ approach provides overall design coherence, whilst allowing scope for the development of individual building identities as well as flexibility to adapt to specific tenant requirements.</p><p>In addition to the masterplan, RSHP was also responsible for the design of three individual office buildings promoting health and wellbeing in the workplace.</p><p>The Financial Conduct Authority provides 48,000m² NIA (net internal area) over twenty storeys of flexible, open plan floorplates. Each floor plate is wrapped around a perimeter atrium and split into three-storey high villages. This arrangement maximises horizontal and vertical connectivity and creates a vibrant hub at the heart of the building.</p><p>Transport for London (TfL) is the smaller of these two buildings, rising to eleven storeys and provides 25,000m² NIA, designed using the same principle of large open floor plates and a central atrium. The two buildings form the enclosure of a significant new public space, Endeavour Square, which accommodates retail and ancillary at ground level to activate the public realm.</p><p>2 Redman Place, the home of Cancer Research UK and the British Council, provides 26,000m² NIA of commercial office space with typical floors providing efficient sub-division into two tenancies, with the possibility of three tenancies. It has been awarded a certification of Outstanding by BREEAM, one of the world’s most recognised industry standards for setting standards of best practice in environmentally positive building design and construction, and a WELL Gold certification for promoting health and well-being through Air, Water, Thermal Comfort, Light, Movement, Nourishment, Sound, Mind, Community and Materials.</p></div>",
