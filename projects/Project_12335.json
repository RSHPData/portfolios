  "overview": "<div><p>Four Seasons Hotel Taipei is a 180m / 591ft tower located in the Xinyi District, directly opposite Taipei 101, one of the most iconic skyscrapers in Asia.  Through three significant outward facing spatial gestures across its elevation, the hotel will embrace the immediate public realm at street level, the rapidly growing Xinyi District at mid-level and Taipei’s incredible mountain setting at its peak, together creating a landmark building that is very much of its place. Surrounded by expansive glass panelling on both sides of the tower, the highest floors will offer wraparound views of the city and mountain ranges on the horizon, whilst the floor-to-ceiling design will allow guests to look out across the cityscape. In addition to the 260 light-filled rooms, the hotel will offer extensive meeting and event spaces, including a grand ballroom and a junior ballroom that will benefit from the same high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling glass panels on offer throughout the building. Ground level lush garden space will also be available for meetings and events. In addition, the hotel will also offer an executive club lounge, fitness centre with an outdoor pool and spa. Dining venues at the Hotel will include a high-end Chinese restaurant, destination bar, specialty restaurant, all-day restaurant, pool bar and lobby lounge.   From an efficient structure to supporting biodiversity with local vegetation species, the building design targets Taiwan Green Building Rating Gold and a minimum LEED silver.</p></div>",
