A multidisciplinary team led by RSHP has developed a masterplan for the City of Paris and the EITMM (Ensemble Immobilier Tour Maine-Montparnasse) landowners’ association to radically transform this pivotal neighbourhood around Montparnasse Station and Tower.</p><p>By rethinking traffic flows across the site, the project proposes the significant pedestrianisation of the streets in the neighbourhood, facilitating wayfinding, walking and cycling. As part of the low-carbon vision for this emblematic Parisian hub, more than 1,000 trees will be planted, creating 10,000m² of green space as part of an “urban forest” conceived by Michel Desvigne Paysagiste.</p><p>The project also proposes a renewal of the site through a strategy of diversification with a range of new residential, office, cultural and sporting amenities serving to strengthen the mix and resilience on the site, as well as seeking to animate and refresh its identity.</p><p>The plinth formed by the shopping centre is opened up, revealed and made more accessible. The commercial offer is redeployed in the form of a pedestrian street that is open to the sky.  Anne Hidalgo, Mayor of Paris said of our proposal: “Our challenge is to transform modernist urbanism of the 1950s and 1970s, to recompose and reconstitute this urban landscape in keeping with Paris’s fabric and with our climate commitments ”. Our masterplan has led to the establishment of the Local Planning Framework for the new Bioclimatic Paris Plan (PLU Bioclimatique), serving as basis to the urban development of the neighbourhood for the next decades.</p><p>As part of the low-carbon vision for this emblematic Parisian hub, more than 1,000 trees will be planted, creating 10,000m² of green space as part of an “urban forest” conceived by Michel Desvigne Paysagiste.
