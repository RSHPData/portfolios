  "overview": "<div><p>The Berkeley Hotel has the charm and character of an English country residence, well-loved and looked after. As essentially residential in character the Hotel is a sequence of connected spaces and rooms with a comfortable and familiar scale and ambience.</p><p>The new entrance canopy, with glazed pavilions flanking the entrance doors, extends the Blue Bar and the Collins Room.</p><p>The practice’s work is defined by a clear structural approach which is evident in the composition. The canopy is supported by a series of expressed carbon fibre beams formed to describe their structural diagram. The beams and glazing system is supported by the existing building and a series of stainless steel columns - the composition is set out on a stone base. The glazing for the canopy and flank walls has a honeycomb insert which reflects light at night and allows for a sense of light, shadow and movement beyond, giving veiled views through the glass. The stone base integrates steps, a rising platform and series of sculpted timber fins forming a protective screen. This entrance design uses traditional and new materials and their composition is unique to The Berkeley.</p><p>The iconic Blue Bar with its memorable interior is retained and the Collins Room has been refurbished with a new interior concept by Robert Angell Design International. With the addition of a new glazed pavilion to each space, their frontage is renewed and gives presence to the street. Internally the spaces feel more integrated and have a more settled sense of space.</p><p>Throughout the works the hotel remained operational, reinvigorating this grand dame of hotels for the future.</p></div>",
