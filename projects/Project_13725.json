  "overview": "<div><p>Pao Huei Renshen is a luxury residential development in Taichung, Taiwanâ€™s second-largest city with over 2.85 million residents. Located near Shakeng Park, the scheme features two elegant towers set within a lushly landscaped site. Tower A, in the southeast quadrant, rises 37 storeys, while Tower B in the northwest reaches 49 storeys. Both towers are connected at ground and second floor via glazed corridors and share a seven-level basement.</p><p>The design emphasizes tall, slender forms that emerge from a planted ground plane. Each tower features an H-shaped floorplate, maximizing natural light and cross-ventilation while enabling the creation of elevated sky gardens at every third floor. These gardens reinforce the relationship between the architecture and the surrounding landscape.</p><p>Living areas and master bedrooms are positioned to capture long views to the north and south, with secondary rooms facing east and west. Green balconies at regular intervals establish a horizontal rhythm across the towers, contrasting with their vertical emphasis. Curved corners on balconies and modular bays define both the structural logic and the appearance of the buildings.</p><p>At ground level and Level 2, the towers are surrounded by a series of interconnected gardens, terraces, pavilions, and canopies that weave through the site. Residents and visitors arrive via a tree-lined avenue in the southwest quadrant, entering through a luminous, stone-clad reception pavilion. From here, they are directed to either tower through the shared lobby.</p><p>Conceptually, each tower aligns with a linear garden -Tower A to the northeast and Tower B to the southwest, where the visitor drop-off is also located. The overall composition creates a dialogue between architecture and nature, with the towers standing as vertical sentinels rooted in a landscape of privacy, greenery, and light.</p></div>",
