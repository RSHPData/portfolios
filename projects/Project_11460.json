  "overview": "<div><p>In 2018 RSHP - as part of a team led by developer Native Land - was appointed by Transport for London (TfL) for the redevelopment of the area around South Kensington Tube station. South Kensington tube station, located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, welcomes over 34 million District and Circle and Piccadilly line customers a year to London’s museum quarter.   The new scheme completes step-free access to both the District and Circle line via a new station entrance on Thurloe Street and the pedestrian subway leading to local destinations, including the Science Museum, Imperial College, the Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p><p>RSHP’s scheme offers new commercial and retail units around the station; refurbishes and creates new housing in the four storey buildings at 20-34 Thurloe Street; replaces the bullnose building retaining its distinctive form, and creates new housing opportunities along TfL’s stretch of land on Pelham Street. The project also includes the renovation of the main station entrances through the Grade II listed shopping arcade.</p></div>",
