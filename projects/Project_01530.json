  "overview": "Rogers’ abiding concern for the social objectives of modern architecture is reflected in this project, intended to provide large numbers of homes at a cost of one-fifth that of more conventional construction methods.\n\nThe basis of the project is the use of high-quality, factory-produced units on a modular system which, due to minimal connection points between one unit and the next, can be quickly assembled on site.\n\n\nHigh-performance, low-energy mechanical and electrical systems are part of an environmentally friendly programme. In addition to the normal services – such as heating, lighting and air-conditioning – the design envisaged provision of security systems, as well as communication, information and entertainment systems appropriate to 21st-century living.\n\nThe units were designed to be used in a flexible way, providing for the needs of a wide range of potential inhabitants. They can form towers or low-rise schemes, depending on the local terrain which in South Korea is often very hilly.",
