  "overview": "This project is located within the masterplan for the Paddington Basin. Adjacent to Paddington Station it offers a revitalised, mixed commercial, residential and retail environment. Waterside, the corporate headquarters for Marks  Spencer, comprises 13 levels of accommodation. Large triangular floor plates provide good levels of daylight and views along the canal.\n\n\nThe building comprises served space – the main occupied floor plates – and servant spaces providing essential support allowing the office floors to function. These elements are distinctly expressed in the form of the building. Two full-height atria with circulation bridges facilitate daylight penetration and create a secondary aspect to the north of the site.\n\n\nThe secondary service elements are distinctly expressed in corner service towers, lending emphasis to the canal edge and to the main entrances from North Wharf Road. The principal circulation towers contain the main passenger lifts and give a strong dynamic identity to the development.",
