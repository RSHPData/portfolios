  "overview": "The essence of this scheme is a flexible plan devised to suit the needs of a highly-automated audio equipment manufacturer. All business activities are accommodated under one roof, thus significantly increasing Linn’s production capability and improving communication between departments.\n\n\nThe design provides a complex of two rectangular blocks. One is a low cost multi-functional building combining administration, research, production and assembly, partly in an undercroft within the sloping site. The second building houses a highly automated warehouse supplying components via robotic carts to the production lines.\n\n\nAll staff are united within common facilities on a superb woodland site. The building is designed to accept 100% expansion capability - repetitive structural and cladding systems allow for simple expansion as required.",
