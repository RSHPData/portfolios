  "overview": "<div><p>Barangaroo South Masterplan was part of a 22-hectare site masterplan to transform a former container port on Sydney's harbour. The masterplan was split into different zones: Barangaroo South for commercial and residential development as an extension of the city’s central business district, (CBD); Central Barangaroo as a low density, predominately residential neighbourhood overlooking a harbourside city park, and Headland Park as a reconstructed, naturalistic landscape for all.</p><p>Covering six hectares of built development, Barangaroo South has become a new city quarter that integrates with the existing urban fabric. At the heart of the scheme are the International Towers Sydney, (2017), three office buildings organised on a fan-shaped grid which adopt the scale and density of the CBD whilst maintaining a fully accessible waterfront.</p><p>Over two-thirds of the development was set aside as public and recreational spaces, including a continuous waterfront promenade that was previously broken by the port, (Wulugul Walk, 2021); an amphitheatre-style boardwalk stepping down to the water, (Watermans Cove, 2025) and a one-hectare park, providing a green retreat for the community, (Hickson Park, 2020).</p><p>The plan reconnects the area with the rest of Sydney by creating strong pedestrian and public transport links, including Wynyard Walk – which brings Wynyard Station to the doorstep of Barangaroo -  and Sussex Street Bridge (2016); a new ferry terminal (Barangaroo Ferry Wharf (2017), and a metro station (Sydney Metro Barangaroo Station, 2024) at Barangaroo Central.</p><p>Part of the Clinton Climate Initiative’s Climate Positive Development Program, Barangaroo South became Australia’s first carbon-neutral precinct in 2019. The area, as well as the International Towers have all been WELL Certified at the Platinum level – making it one of the world’s most sustainable multi-use precincts. In addition the towers have all been recognized with a 6 Star Green Star rating – the highest level of sustainability for a building - from the Green Building Council of Australia.</p></div>",
