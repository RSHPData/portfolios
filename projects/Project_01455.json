  "overview": "<div><p>The key feature of the development is the spectacular parkland forming the heart of the site. The focal point of the park is a large lake, with a canopied timber boardwalk from which the entrance to each building is arranged.</p><p>The landscape is divided into an ‘inner garden’ and outer landscape areas, the former is highly detailed, while the latter is a softer, informal zone providing a park-like backdrop of native planting where green ‘fingers’ extend between the buildings, through to the perimeter car parks.</p><p>Chiswick Park has been developed as a place favouring people rather than vehicles. Designed for pedestrian priority (75 percent of those working at Chiswick Park arrive on foot, by bicycle, bus or train), all vehicular activity is routed around the edge of the site, to screened carparks or undercrofts beneath the buildings.</p><p>The design for each building is developed as ‘served’ and ‘servant’ space, in which a central core (servant) is surrounded by uninterrupted three metre-high floor to ceiling office floors (served), assisted by external escape stairs which contribute to the distinctive identity of the scheme. Full height, glazed central atria provide views out into the park and bring natural light into the office space. The depth of each building varies, as determined by the masterplan, resulting in a variety of building sizes and contributing to the richness of the scheme as a whole.</p><p>The facades are fully glazed to maximise views and daylight, and enclose large, unobstructed office spaces. The comprehensive energy strategy includes fixed external sunshades in the form of a canopy of louvres at roof level as well as retractable fabric blinds on the east and west facades that are operated automatically via roof-mounted light sensors. Together, these shade 90 percent of the building’s surfaces, and together with a displacement heating and cooling system and the extensive use of natural ventilation, significantly reduce the requirement for air-conditioning.</p></div>",
  "concept": "<div><p>The RSHP masterplan consists of twelve buildings with a total of 1.4 million square feet of office space, as well as parking for 1,700 cars, a health club, swimming pool, and brasserie-cafe set within a landscaped public space complete with open-air performance space and pond.</p><p>These facilities are designed to enhance the work-life balance of the occupants, supporting the concept of social sustainability. The buildings, arranged around the perimeter of the site enjoy views over the park with its central lake with three metre high waterfall, bridge and boardwalks, and extensive soft landscaped areas.</p><p>Each building at Chiswick Park is standardised taking advantage of off-site construction technology to maximise time and cost benefits. This approach reflects Stanhope’s conviction that a very high quality, distinctive and flexible development can be achieved using standardised components and built to conform to tight commercial constraints. To this end, the office buildings contain highly flexible space that can be configured in open plan or cellular form. Each floor plate can also be let as a single tenancy or as multiple tenancies split into divisions of two, three or four separate, fully independent tenancies.</p></div>",
