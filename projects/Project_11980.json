  "overview": "<div><p>210 South 12th Street is a 32-floor residential tower near Philadelphia’s CBD, offering three retail units at its base, with 448 rental apartments above.</p><p>The building adopts a rotational geometry that maximises daylight into the apartments and increases the number of dual aspect corner units; it also creates pockets of space at the ground floor to be articulated with landscaping.</p><p>The design echoes the former industrial heritage of the area, responding in a contemporary language which reinterprets the colouration and materials of the local architectural character. The perimeter structure is expressed with an extruded aluminium system, framing the floors into three-story rectangular modules.</p><p>Corrugated shadow box panels pick up on the tonality of the local brick vernacular and add a grain and human scale to the building. The upper floors of the tower are set back in to provide open-air amenity terraces at the upper levels with panoramic views of the city.</p></div>",
