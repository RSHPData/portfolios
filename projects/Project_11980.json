  "overview": "210 South 12th Street is a 32-floor residential tower near Philadelphia’s CBD, offering three retail units at its base, with 448 rental apartments above.\n\nThe building adopts a rotational geometry that maximises daylight into the apartments and increases the number of dual aspect corner units; it also creates pockets of space at the ground floor to be articulated with landscaping.\n\nThe design echoes the former industrial heritage of the area, responding in a contemporary language which reinterprets the colouration and materials of the local architectural character. The perimeter structure is expressed with an extruded aluminium system, framing the floors into three-story rectangular modules. \n\nCorrugated shadow box panels pick up on the tonality of the local brick vernacular and add a grain and human scale to the building. The upper floors of the tower are set back in to provide open-air amenity terraces at the upper levels with panoramic views of the city.\n\nThe tower is due for completion in 2023.",
