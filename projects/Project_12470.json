  "overview": "<div style =\"break-inside:avoid-column;\"><p style='margin-bottom:22px'>The Zurich Airport AG competition comprised a number of expansion projects at Zurich Airport, Switzerland, including an extension to Dock A, the air traffic control tower, the baggage sorting area, new connections, and a central bus station.</p></div><div style =\"break-inside:avoid-column;margin-top:22px\"><p style='margin-bottom:22px'>RSHP’s highly cost efficient design proposal for Dock A - to be built north of the existing dock - was a contemporary Swiss chalet that would offer a clear and legible building form and complement the airport’s new additions.</p></div><div style =\"break-inside:avoid-column;margin-top:22px\"><p>The air traffic control tower would be supported by a technical building and a base support building that could be integrated into the tower facility.</p><p style='margin-bottom:22px'>A new concourse would form a natural extension of the Airside Centre, and together with the Airport Forum, would form a generous expansion of the commercial areas. Spacious lounge and restaurant facilities would offer spectacular views over the entire airport, including the Control Tower, and the Swiss landscape.</p></div><div style =\"break-inside:avoid-column;margin-top:22px\"><p>A central atrium would be at the heart of the commercial space which would have expanded food and beverage areas to maximise commercial revenue and increase visual appeal on different levels.</p></div>",
