  "overview": "<div><p>Occupying a prominent corner site opposite Taichung’s National Theatre, this pavilion serves as a marketing suite for the promotion of new residential developments. However, Pao Huei recognises the site’s cultural significance and has envisioned the building as a venue for public events, thereby enhancing the civic life of the city.</p><p>Designed as a standalone structure, the building contrasts deliberately with its taller urban surroundings. It is conceived as a flower on the forest floor - visually delicate yet distinctive and intended to be appreciated both at street level and from above as a subtle landmark in the cityscape.</p><p>A refined structural frame envelops the pavilion, presenting it as a singular ‘wrapped’ volume over four floors. Within this expressive framework lies a restrained, elegant core containing apartment display spaces. These are framed by two principal areas. At ground level, a reception space merges interior and exterior conditions, drawing in the landscape and guiding visitors along a formal promenade from the street. At the top of the building, a multifunctional, acoustically tuned performance hall sits beneath the apex of the frame, top-lit and offering a grand balcony with views toward the National Theatre.</p><p>A daylit staircase forms a central spine, rising through the building and visible from the main entrance. It connects all levels and emphasises the building’s formal organisation.</p><p>Internally, the pavilion is lined throughout with veneered timber panels, selected for both acoustic performance and aesthetic consistency. This continuous material treatment lends the interior the character of a finely crafted object - both warm and precise. Together, the structure and its envelope create an architecture of refined presence: modest in scale yet resonant in expression, a civic flower rooted in the cultural landscape of Taichung.</p></div>",
