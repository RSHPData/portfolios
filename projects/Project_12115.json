  "overview": "Inno-tech Guiwan, a designated youth entrepreneurship zone, offers an oasis of innovation and creates an urban work‒life balance community in Qianhai. This urban innovation and creativity hub is a pedestrianised, completely vehicle-free, masterplan development with a central public square and park, surrounded by walkable streets, green courtyards with urban gardens and trees and water features.\n\nThe central square provides a series of shared outdoor spaces for social meetings and gatherings, performances, sports and other leisure activities, relaxation and regeneration.\n\n\nA cluster of lower and elevated buildings with planted terraces, vertical green villages and sky gardens on a gentle urban slope hosts a raised landmark cultural and arts building providing a large multi-purpose hall, exhibition and office spaces. Commercial spaces are flexible and column-free, with options to be divided into open plan, cellular or mixed office units.\n\nThe building design and layout is based on flexibility, adaptability with physical and visual connectivity. In contrast to the new 'super high rise' developments within the Qianhai area of Shenzhen, this 'super low rise' development aims to create a people focused concept for an 'urban living room'.",
