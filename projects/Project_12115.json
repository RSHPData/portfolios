  "overview": "<div><p>Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Youth Entrepreneurship Zone, a designated youth entrepreneurship zone, offers an oasis of innovation and creates an urban work-life balance community in Qianhai. The zone will focus on artificial intelligence, big data, life and health, Internet of Things (IOT), blockchain, cloud computing, science technology, and culture.</p><p>Containing both a metro and bus station, the site forms a dynamic link between the local community and the emerging skyline. The project comprises of 16 buildings, all connected by an elevated sky deck with landscaped gardens accommodating primarily flexible office floor space, in addition to amenity and retail programs situated within a large, landscaped park. This urban innovation and creativity hub is a pedestrianised, masterplan development with a central public square and central park, surrounded by walkable streets, green courtyards with urban gardens and trees and water features. The central square provides a series of shared outdoor spaces for social meetings and gatherings, performances, sports and other leisure activities, relaxation and regeneration. A cluster of lower and elevated buildings with planted terraces, vertical green villages and sky gardens on a gentle urban slope hosts a raised landmark cultural and arts building providing a large multi-purpose hall, exhibition and office spaces.</p><p>Commercial spaces are flexible and column free, with options to be divided into open plan, cellular or mixed office units. The building design and layout is based on flexibility, adaptability and physical and visual connectivity. In contrast to the new ‘super high rise’ developments within the Qianhai area of Shenzhen, this ‘super low rise’ development aims to create a people focused concept for an ‘urban living room’.</p></div>",
