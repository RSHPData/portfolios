  "overview": "After 30 years based at Thames Wharf in Hammersmith, West London, RSHP relocated to The Leadenhall Building in 2015.\nThe studio, on Level 14 of the 48-storey building, enables it to accommodate all its 180 staff on one floor, strengthening communication and collaborative working, and bringing a distinctive ethos and culture to a new London landmark. \nThe fit-out of the studio reinterprets the practice’s design philosophy as flexible, legible space which will be conducive to a collaborative approach to design. \nThe building’s completely open floorplate gives sight lines across the whole studio, and beyond to St Paul’s Cathedral, Canary Wharf and Lloyd’s of London. Desks are arranged in three groups aligned to each of the facades, giving the best aspect for all staff.  Generous circulation space and a large kitchen give opportunities for chance encounters and informal conversations and the central meeting area, open on two sides and visible to all, provides flexible space capable of hosting small meetings, lectures and events for up to 200 people. \nThe fit-out takes full advantage of the shell and core design of the building. By exposing the soffit and services, rather than putting in a suspended ceiling as other tenants in the building have done, the full height of the space is revealed. Lighting design by Speirs Major is closely aligned to natural circadian rhythms, changing in tone through the day to mimic circadian patterns.\nThe Modelshop and server room are located within the main studio space, open to view as integral parts of the life of the practice. \nThere are no ‘corner offices’ at RSHP, reflecting the democratic philosophy of the practice. Instead, the corners are given over to quiet space, for meetings, reflection and relaxation.",
