  "overview": "181 Talgarth Road is purpose-built student accommodation in Hammersmith, west London. The scheme will deliver 357 rooms, with rent capped by the Mayor of London. \nThe design progressively ‘steps down’ every two bays, reducing the height by 8.55m as it moves away from the Hammersmith Flyover, reaching the lowest terrace height of approximately 26.5m. \nThe north and south frontages have a pixelated facade made up of transparent, translucent, and solid panels arranged in a dispersed composition to reduce overlooking the residents. The transparency and translucency ratios are graded to suit the needs of the orientation, light and visibility of the accommodation.\nThe lower two levels are glazed wherever possible, to create an open and connected view across from Talgarth Road to the public piazza at the heart of the scheme. The ends of the building are angled to create an inviting public pathway to the public square and entrance to the building, and to give breathing space to the hotel on the south.\nAn external canopy is proposed that can be fully accessed by the public, providing shelter to four blue badge bays, opportunities for public activities and events. A central core marks the building’s presence as seen from Talgarth Road.\nThe proposals include significant new public realm improvements including new greenery and a centrepiece canopy. The plans will retain trees along Talgarth Road and plant further trees across the new courtyard and around the public realm to create a more biodiverse and green experience throughout the site.\nThe scheme is designed to meet and exceed planning policy, including through BREEAM Excellent accreditation and being “Air Quality Neutral”.",
