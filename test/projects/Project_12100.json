  "overview": "<div><p>The Tall Timber Tower research and design project, funded in part by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Supertall Timber research programme, is a collaboration between RSHP, the Cambridge University Centre for Natural Material Innovation, Gardiner & Theobald and Atelier One.</p><p>It demonstrates the viability of a standard office building at a new scale in timber, using components and materials that are commercially available today.</p><p>The tower is 160m tall and 45m wide with a gross internal area of 83,580m2. It uses 16,500 metric tonnes of timber – an equivalent traditional build would use 76,600 metric tonnes of concrete or 35,580 metric tonnes of steel – which significantly reduces foundation loads and build time. An engineered timber veneer also improves its structural properties, and the building performs well under fire-loading.</p><p>The facade is composed of diagrids which carry the lateral loads as axial force and enable the external skin to be free from vertical columns: gravity loads are taken both by this external skin and internal columns and the corners are curved to reduce wind pressure and avoid peak forces. The floor system is a pinned frame which ensures no movement is transferred between beams and columns.</p><p>The Tall Timber Tower highlights the architectural, engineering, and economic possibilities that stem from thinking about traditional materials in new ways, but it also indicates a great environmental benefit. Preliminary analysis indicates that 26,000 tonnes of carbon would be sequestered by using timber, thereby slowing atmospheric C02 pollution and mitigating global warming.</p></div>",
